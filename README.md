<!-- About the template
  This template wants to provide you in sharing free education.
  It trys to be formated in a way to work with a lot of different platforms which support the Markdown-syntax.
  Most Markdown-interpreters support also HTML, others only support a limited set of the Markdown-syntax.
  This Template trys to handle its all.
  Examples of Markdown-interpreters:
  - Obsidian.md (can even transclude documents)
  - GitHub      (can render but not transclude)
  - Matrix      (can only render a small subset of Markdown)
  Beside this compatibility problem and also the problem of limited characters per message in some messenger-systems, this template also wants to provide a smal multi-purpouse format that supports easy copy-paste handling.
